This project creates a responsive sidebar navigation menu for a dashboard-style web application.

## Features

- Fully responsive sidebar that collapses into a menu icon on smaller screens
- Expandable links section with menu items
- Search bar
- User profile and logout link

## Usage

The sidebar is contained in `index.html` and styled using `style.css`.

To initialize the sidebar's functionality, the `script.js` file handles:  

- Toggling the sidebar open/closed on mobile  
- Expanding link sections
- Showing tooltips on hover

Further customization can be done by modifying the HTML structure, CSS styles, or JS interactions.

The sidebar can be reused easily by copying over the relevant sections into another project.

## Customization

Some ways the sidebar can be customized:  

- Brand logo, colors, fonts
- Link icons and names  
- Profile image and user details
- Animations and transitions   

The section dividers, hover effects, etc can also be adjusted by editing the CSS.
